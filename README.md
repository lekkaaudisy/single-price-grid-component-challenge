## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Using a flexbox for desktop and mobile devices

### Screenshot

![](./images/screenshot-2.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Box Model and Styling

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

1. **Flexbox Layout**: The CSS code extensively uses Flexbox layout properties to create responsive and flexible designs. The display: flex property is used on the .card-holder, .card, .bot-card, .subscription, and .why-us elements to create flexible containers. Flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction are utilized to control the alignment and positioning of the elements.

2. **CSS Variables**: The :root selector is used to define CSS variables, which are then used throughout the code to set color values. Variables like --cyan, --bright-yellow, --light-gray, --grayish-blue, and --darkish-cyan are defined and referenced in various places to maintain consistency and facilitate easy color theme customization.

3. **Box Model and Styling**: The CSS code demonstrates the usage of the box model by setting margin, padding, and border-radius. The box-sizing: border-box property ensures that the padding and border values are included within the specified width and height, making it easier to calculate the size of elements. The box-shadow property is used to add a subtle shadow effect to the .card element.

### Continued development

As my CSS codebase grows, it's important to maintain a well-organized and modular structure. Maybe I will consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or LESS to leverage features like variables, mixins, and nested rules, which can improve code readability and maintainability. Additionally, I want to explore methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier) or SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) to better structure my CSS code.
